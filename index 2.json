To cope with this threat, integrated pathogen management strategies combine disease-resistant plants, sensors monitoring technologies, and fungicides either preventively or curatively, which come with their associated monetary and environmental costs. This work presents a methodology for timely detection of YR that cuts down on hardware and computational requirements. It enables frequent detailed monitoring of the spread of YR, hence providing the opportunity to better target mitigation efforts which is critical for successful integrated disease management. The method is trained to detect YR symptoms using reflectance spectrum (VIS–NIR) and a classification algorithm at different stages of YR development to distinguish them from typical defense responses occurring in resistant wheat. The classification method was trained and tested on four different spectral datasets. The results showed that using a full spectral range, a selection of the top 5% significant spectral features, or five typical multispectral bands for early detection of YR in infected plants yielded a true positive rate of 86%, for infected plants. The same data analysis with digital camera bands provided a true positive rate of 77%. These findings lay the groundwork for the development of high-throughput YR screening in the field implementing multispectral digital camera sensors that can be mounted on autonomous vehicles or a drone as part of an integrated disease management scheme.","tags":[],"title":"Spectral light-reflection data dimensionality reduction for timely detection of yellow rust","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1594821654,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594821654,"objectID":"2558328282fbb841937d2a9c3b7935dc","permalink":"https://snyoung2.github.io./talk/2020/asabe/","publishdate":"2020-01-10T11:27:54-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2020/asabe/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Analyzing Sensor Data at the Source","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1594568754,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594568754,"objectID":"46bd4704d55b58554c378481838e1f47","permalink":"https://snyoung2.github.io./talk/2020/rss/","publishdate":"2020-01-10T11:27:54-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2020/rss/","section":"talk","summary":"Emerging applications indicate that physical interaction and manipulation with remote environments will be increasingly important tasks for small, uncrewed aerial systems (UAS), particularly in applications such as environmental sampling and infrastructure testing. Broadly speaking, however, most UAS manipulation tasks are not yet fully autonomous due to challenges in perception and control, thus the availability of a human operator to monitor and intervene during telemanipulation remains essential. However, how to most effectively enable remote telemanipulation by a semiautonomous human-UAS team remains an open question. This work addresses this question by taking a hybrid autonomy approach to utilize the system’s autonomous capabilities while taking advantage of the domain expertise of the operator when the remote environment is unknown. Specifically, this work focuses both on control development and human-robot interface design for a UAS manipulation system and their effects on telemanipulation task performance. Results from this work indicate that successful remote manipulation is possible by non-expert users, although experimental validation in multiple domains is needed. The practical contributions of this work aim to expedite the use of aerial manipulation technologies by scientists, researchers, and stakeholders, particularly in the civil, environmental, and agricultural domains, who will directly benefit from improved manipulating UAS performance.","tags":[],"title":"Towards Enabling Remote Telemanipulation by Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) in Unknown Environments","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593201654,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593201654,"objectID":"7863d552447b43effefafca685022fc3","permalink":"https://snyoung2.github.io./talk/2020/intrinsyc/","publishdate":"2020-01-10T11:27:54-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2020/intrinsyc/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Using Robotics, Sensing, and Automation to Improve the Throughput of Phenotyping","type":"talk"},{"authors":["G.

Current elevation measurement approaches, such as manual surveying and LiDAR, are costly and infrequent, leading to potential inefficiencies for quantifying the dynamic hydrologic storage capacity of the land surface over large areas. Experiments to evaluate a team of two different robots, including an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and an unmanned surface vehicle (USV), to collect hydrologic surface data utilizing sonar and visual sensors were conducted at three different field sites within the Arkavathy Basin river network located near Bangalore in Karnataka, South India. Visual sensors were used on the UAV to capture high resolution imagery for topographic characterization, and sonar sensors were deployed on the USV to capture bathymetric readings; the data streams were fused in an automated workflow to determine the storage capacity of agricultural reservoirs (also known as ``tanks'') at the three field sites. This study suggests: (i) this robot-assisted methodology is low-cost and suitable for novice users, and (ii) storage capacity data collected at previously unmapped locations revealed strong power-type relationships between surface area, stage, and storage volume, which can be incorporated into modeling of landscape-scale hydrology. This methodology is of importance to water researchers and practitioners because it produces local, high-resolution representations of bathymetry and topography and enables water balance computations at small-watershed scales, which offer insight into the present-day dynamics of a strongly human impacted watershed.","tags":[],"title":"Robot-Assisted Measurement for Hydrologic Understanding in Data Sparse Regions","type":"publication"}]
