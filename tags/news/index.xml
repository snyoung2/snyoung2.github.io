      <description>The Young Lab is currently seeking highly motivated graduate students to conduct research developing innovative robotics and sensing technologies for agricultural and environmental monitoring. Students will be part of collaborative, multi-disciplinary projects that seek to improve the sensing and sense-making process in diverse applications, including plant phenotying, environmental monitoring, and precision agriculture. The positions are particularly well-suited for students interested in a mixture of hardware development, data analytics, and field work.</description>
